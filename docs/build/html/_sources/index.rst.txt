KDAP: Knowledge Data Analysis and Processing Platform
=====================================================
KDAP contains a collection of utilities for efficiently processing and
analyzing the data of Wiki-based and QnA-based portals (eg., Wikipedia, Wikia,
Stack Exchange, etc.). The function takes Knol-ML files as input. Most of the
functions of this library are implemented in such a way that parallel processing
can be achieved.
The source code can be found on `github <https://github.com/descentis/kdap>`_.
