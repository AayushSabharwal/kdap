# Knowledge Data Analysis and Processing Platform
This library contains a collection of utilities for efficiently processing and anlyzing the data of Wiki-based and QnA-based portals (eg., Wikipedia, Wikia, Stack Exchange, etc.). The function takes Knol-ML files as input. Most of the functions on this library are implemented such that parallel computation can be achieved.
